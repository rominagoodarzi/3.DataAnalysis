This repository represents a project I previously completed as a research assistant. I revisited the code in Jupyter and employed linear regression to examine if consumers are inclined to pay higher prices for items associated with charitable donations. The analysis focused on exploring the connection between the final auction prices on eBay and various product and auction attributes.
